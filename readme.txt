Easy WP LaTeX provides a very easy way to display math and equations in your posts.

== Description ==

*Easy WP LaTeX* provides a very easy way to display equations or mathematical formulas  (typed in as TeX or LaTeX code) in your posts.

Most LaTeX/equation plugins I have seen suffer from a few drawbacks.

1. They require installations of TeX or other packages on your server.
1. They are fairly inflexible in terms of colors of text and background.
1. Each time you switch your theme, you have to re-configure your color scheme.
1. They may not let you choose how to input LaTeX code. ([math]...[/math] or $$...$$) without editing the plugin code.

My plugin aims to be flexible, and easy to install (no geeky code editing etc.).

PS: You may need to [change the file permission of the cache](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions).

If you like *Easy WP LaTeX*, you may want to check out my other plugins: [Easy AdSenser](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-adsenser/ "The simplest way to put AdSense to work for you") and [Theme Tweaker](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-tweaker/ "To tweak the colors in your theme with no CSS/PHP editing").

This plugin is based on *Latex for WordPess* by zhiqiang, and shares some features and core engine code with it.

Two possible reasons.

1. *Easy WP LaTeX* is so simple and straight-forward that no question could be thought of.
1. More likely, the plugin is too new for any questions.
